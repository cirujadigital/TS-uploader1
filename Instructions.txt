This programs lets you send data from serial port to Thingspeak. It was written to use with an Arduino board and sensors. In order to use it, you have to:

1) Create a thingspeak user (www.thingspeak.com)
2) Create a new channel and enable 3 fields at least.
3) Generate a write API KEY.
4) Copy and paste te API KEY inside the "api.txt" file (you can find this file inside the data folder).
5) Program your Arduino in order to send data through the serial Port following this structure:

 
Serial.println(Value1+","+Value2+","+Value3+","+Value4","+Value5+","+Value6+","+Value7+","+Value8);
 delay(t); //where t= 15 seconds minimum.


NOTE: If you are going to send just two values, then you have to left in blank the rest of the values, BUT leave the comma:
   i.e., if you send values to field1 and field2: Serial.print(value1+","+value2+","+","+","+","+","+",")


6) Connect the board to USB, open the program and write Serial Port Number's order (if the USB port is number 30 on the list, then write 30)

7) Hit Enter and the programm will start sending data to your thingspeak channel automatically.
